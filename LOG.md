| P001 | April 20, 2020 | [Description of Day 001 work](001) | Description of what I learned. |
D1 | 23-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D1 Getting started. Updated XCode. Basic syntax review today: simple types including variables, constants, string interpolation, type inference & annotations. Reviewed this using the amazing Unwrap iOS app. #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D2 | 24-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D2  More basic syntax: Complex types incl. arrays, sets, tuples, dictionaries, enums. Practised writing different complex types; some empty; items added and removed (not tuples!); with type annotations; defaults values; assign values to enums;  #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D3 | 25-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D3 More basic syntax: operators and conditions. Swift has a neat ternary operator and, ooh look, switch statements too. #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D4 | 26-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D4 More basic syntax: going loopy over loops. For and while loops and a weird repeat loop. Continue and break, plus a way to break out of nested loops. Python’s truthiness thinking caught me out when testing myself using the Unwrap app I think. #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D5 | 27-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D5 More basic syntax: Functions! Accepting parameters, returning values, default parameters, variadic functions, throwing functions. Found myself questioning how Python copes with all this by comparison. I'm still learning Swift syntax for sure. #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode  |
D6 | 28-Apr | Must revisit this! | R2D6 Closures! Variables store information in code, and functions execute tasks. With closures, you put a function’s code in a variable, pass it around, and execute its code somewhere else. Parameters of a closure aren’t named, unlike functions #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
