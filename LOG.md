| P001 | April 20, 2020 | [Description of Day 001 work](001) | Description of what I learned. |
D1 | 23-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D1 Getting started. Updated XCode. Basic syntax review today: simple types including variables, constants, string interpolation, type inference & annotations. Reviewed this using the amazing Unwrap iOS app. #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D2 | 24-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D2  More basic syntax: Complex types incl. arrays, sets, tuples, dictionaries, enums. Practised writing different complex types; some empty; items added and removed (not tuples!); with type annotations; defaults values; assign values to enums;  #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D3 | 25-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D3 More basic syntax: operators and conditions. Swift has a neat ternary operator and, ooh look, switch statements too. #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D4 | 26-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D4 More basic syntax: going loopy over loops. For and while loops and a weird repeat loop. Continue and break, plus a way to break out of nested loops. Python’s truthiness thinking caught me out when testing myself using the Unwrap app I think. #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D5 | 27-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D5 More basic syntax: Functions! Accepting parameters, returning values, default parameters, variadic functions, throwing functions. Found myself questioning how Python copes with all this by comparison. I'm still learning Swift syntax for sure. #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode  |
D6 | 28-Apr | Must revisit this! | R2D6 Closures! Variables store information in code, and functions execute tasks. With closures, you put a function’s code in a variable, pass it around, and execute its code somewhere else. Parameters of a closure aren’t named, unlike functions #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D7 | 29-Apr | Will revisit this | R2D7 more Closures! After finishing a work Teams call late I’m tired and the second session of closures in Swift is going to have to be repeated. Luckily some consolidation days are planned ahead.  #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D8 | 30-Apr | Learning debt is stacking up! | R2D8 Structs. Started reading up on Swift structs and thought they should just be called classes!? The Swift manual suggests classes have additional capabilities that structures don’t have. Didn’t get time to quiz myself tonight using Unwrap app.  #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
