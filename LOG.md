D1 | 23-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D1 Getting started. Updated XCode. Basic syntax review today: simple types including variables, constants, string interpolation, type inference & annotations. Reviewed this using the amazing Unwrap iOS app. #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D2 | 24-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D2  More basic syntax: Complex types incl. arrays, sets, tuples, dictionaries, enums. Practised writing different complex types; some empty; items added and removed (not tuples!); with type annotations; defaults values; assign values to enums;  #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D3 | 25-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D3 More basic syntax: operators and conditions. Swift has a neat ternary operator and, ooh look, switch statements too. #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
D4 | 26-Apr | Consumed today! | R2D4 More basic syntax: going loopy over loops. For and while loops and a weird repeat loop. Continue and break, plus a way to break out of nested loops. Pythonâ€™s truthiness thinking caught me out when testing myself using the Unwrap app I think. #HackingWithSwift #100DaysOfCode |
