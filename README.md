## Hacking With Swift / 100 Days Of Swift Challenge 
### (start date - end date)

* Kicking off the challenge: [100 Days of Swift, 100 Days of Code](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100).

* See all I coded in my [progress log](LOG.md) which I [tweeted out](https://twitter.com/anthlis) daily with the #100DaysOfSwift and #hackingwithswift hashtags.

* Original 100 Days idea by [Alexander Kallaway](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4).
